# Pergola projects

These are my personal pergola projects. They are unsupported, full of bugs and probably not doing things correctly anyway.

Verilog projects are located in `verilog`. Change working directory to a project and type `make` to build, `make prog` to build and program.

nMigen projects are in `pergola`. To explore the cli, remain in this directory and run `python -m pergola --help` and read the docs for more help. Running blinky is done like so `python -m pergola run blinky`.
